 (name ocamlfilt)
 (synopsis "Demangle OCaml symbol names")
 (description "OCaml implementation of demangling OCaml symbols. ocamlfilt works similarly to c++filt, in that it accepts mangled symbol names as command line arguments, and if none are provided it accepts mangled symbols from stdin. Demangled symbols are written to stdout.")
